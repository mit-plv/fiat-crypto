(*** Barrett Reduction *)
(** This file implements a slightly-generalized version of Barrett
    Reduction on [Z].  This version follows a middle path between the
    Handbook of Applied Cryptography (Algorithm 14.42) and Wikipedia.
    We split up the shifting and the multiplication so that we don't
    need to store numbers that are quite so large, but we don't do
    early reduction modulo [b^(k+offset)] (we generalize from HAC's [k
    ± 1] to [k ± offset]).  This leads to weaker conditions on the
    base ([b]), exponent ([k]), and the [offset] than those given in
    the HAC. *)

  (** Quoting Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_reduction>: *)
  (** In modular arithmetic, Barrett reduction is a reduction
      algorithm introduced in 1986 by P.D. Barrett. A naive way of
      computing *)
  (** [c = a mod n] *)
  (** would be to use a fast division algorithm. Barrett reduction is
      an algorithm designed to optimize this operation assuming [n] is
      constant, and [a < n²], replacing divisions by
      multiplications. *)

    (** Let [m = 1 / n] be the inverse of [n] as a floating point
        number. Then *)
    (** [a mod n = a - ⌊a m⌋ n] *)
    (** where [⌊ x ⌋] denotes the floor function. The result is exact,
        as long as [m] is computed with sufficient accuracy. *)

    (* [/] is [Z.div], which means truncated division *)

  (** * Barrett algorithm *)
  Section barrett_algorithm.
    (** Barrett algorithm is a fixed-point analog which expresses
        everything in terms of integers. Let [k] be the smallest
        integer such that [2ᵏ > n]. Think of [n] as representing the
        fixed-point number [n 2⁻ᵏ]. We precompute [m] such that [m =
        ⌊4ᵏ / n⌋]. Then [m] represents the fixed-point number
        [m 2⁻ᵏ ≈ (n 2⁻ᵏ)⁻¹]. *)
    (** N.B. We don't need [k] to be the smallest such integer. *)
    (** N.B. We generalize to an arbitrary base. *)
    (** N.B. We generalize from [k ± 1] to [k ± offset]. *)

    (** Wikipedia neglects to mention non-negativity, but we need it.
        It might be possible to do with a relaxed assumption, such as
        the sign of [a] and the sign of [n] being the same; but I
        figured it wasn't worth it. *)
