  (** Quoting Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_modular_multiplication>: *)
  (** In modular arithmetic computation, Montgomery modular
      multiplication, more commonly referred to as Montgomery
      multiplication, is a method for performing fast modular
      multiplication, introduced in 1985 by the American mathematician
      Peter L. Montgomery. *)
  (** Given two integers [a] and [b], the classical modular
      multiplication algorithm computes [ab mod N]. Montgomery
      multiplication works by transforming [a] and [b] into a special
      representation known as Montgomery form. For a modulus [N], the
      Montgomery form of [a] is defined to be [aR mod N] for some
      constant [R] depending only on [N] and the underlying computer
      architecture. If [aR mod N] and [bR mod N] are the Montgomery
      forms of [a] and [b], then their Montgomery product is [abR mod
      N]. Montgomery multiplication is a fast algorithm to compute the
      Montgomery product. Transforming the result out of Montgomery
      form yields the classical modular product [ab mod N]. *)

  (** * Modular arithmetic and Montgomery form *)
  Section general.
    (** Addition and subtraction in Montgomery form are the same as
        ordinary modular addition and subtraction because of the
        distributive law: *)
    (** [aR + bR = (a+b)R], *)
    (** [aR - bR = (a-b)R]. *)
    (** This is a consequence of the fact that, because [gcd(R, N) =
        1], multiplication by [R] is an isomorphism on the additive
        group [ℤ/Nℤ]. *)

    Definition add : montgomeryZ -> montgomeryZ -> montgomeryZ := fun aR bR => aR + bR.
    Definition sub : montgomeryZ -> montgomeryZ -> montgomeryZ := fun aR bR => aR - bR.

    (** Multiplication in Montgomery form, however, is seemingly more
        complicated. The usual product of [aR] and [bR] does not
        represent the product of [a] and [b] because it has an extra
        factor of R: *)
    (** [(aR mod N)(bR mod N) mod N = (abR)R mod N]. *)
    (** Computing products in Montgomery form requires removing the
        extra factor of [R]. While division by [R] is cheap, the
        intermediate product [(aR mod N)(bR mod N)] is not divisible
        by [R] because the modulo operation has destroyed that
        property. *)
    (** Removing the extra factor of R can be done by multiplying by
        an integer [R′] such that [RR' ≡ 1 (mod N)], that is, by an
        [R′] whose residue class is the modular inverse of [R] mod
        [N]. Then, working modulo [N], *)
    (** [(aR mod N)(bR mod N)R' ≡ (aR)(bR)R⁻¹ ≡ (ab)R  (mod N)]. *)

  End general.

  (** * The REDC algorithm *)
  Section redc.
    (** While the above algorithm is correct, it is slower than
        multiplication in the standard representation because of the
        need to multiply by [R′] and divide by [N]. Montgomery
        reduction, also known as REDC, is an algorithm that
        simultaneously computes the product by [R′] and reduces modulo
        [N] more quickly than the naive method. The speed is because
        all computations are done using only reduction and divisions
        with respect to [R], not [N]: *)

    (** * Arithmetic in Montgomery form *)
    Section arithmetic.
      (** Many operations of interest modulo [N] can be expressed
          equally well in Montgomery form. Addition, subtraction,
          negation, comparison for equality, multiplication by an
          integer not in Montgomery form, and greatest common divisors
          with [N] may all be done with the standard algorithms. *)
      (** When [R > N], most other arithmetic operations can be
          expressed in terms of REDC. This assumption implies that the
          product of two representatives [mod N] is less than [RN],
          the exact hypothesis necessary for REDC to generate correct
          output. In particular, the product of [aR mod N] and [bR mod
          N] is [REDC((aR mod N)(bR mod N))]. The combined operation
          of multiplication and REDC is often called Montgomery
          multiplication. *)
      Definition mul : montgomeryZ -> montgomeryZ -> montgomeryZ
        := fun aR bR => reduce (aR * bR).

      (** Conversion into Montgomery form is done by computing
          [REDC((a mod N)(R² mod N))]. Conversion out of Montgomery
          form is done by computing [REDC(aR mod N)]. The modular
          inverse of [aR mod N] is [REDC((aR mod N)⁻¹(R³ mod
          N))]. Modular exponentiation can be done using
          exponentiation by squaring by initializing the initial
          product to the Montgomery representation of 1, that is, to
          [R mod N], and by replacing the multiply and square steps by
          Montgomery multiplies. *)
