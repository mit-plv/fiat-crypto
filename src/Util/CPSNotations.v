(** A value of type [~>R] accepts a continuation that takes an
     argument of type [R].  It is meant to be used in [Definition] and
     such; for example:
<<
     Definition add_cps (a b:nat) : ~> nat.
>>
     The return type of the continuation is not yet specified; every
     [~> R] is universally quantified over the possible return types
     of the continuations that it can be applied to.

(** The type [A ~> R] contains functions that takes an argument of
  type [A] and pass a value of type [R] to the continuation. Functions
  that take multiple arguments can be encoded as [A -> B ~> C] or [A
  ~> B ~>C] -- the first form requires both arguments to be specified
  before its output can be CPS-bound, the latter must be bound once it
  is partially applied to one argument. *)
