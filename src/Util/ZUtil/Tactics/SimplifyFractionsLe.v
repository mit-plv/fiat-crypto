  (** * [Z.simplify_fractions_le] *)
  (** The culmination of this series of tactics,
      [Z.simplify_fractions_le], will use the fact that [a * (b / c) <=
      (a * b) / c], and do some reasoning modulo associativity and
      commutativity in [Z] to perform such a reduction.  It may leave
      over goals if it cannot prove that some denominators are non-zero.
      If the rewrite [a * (b / c)] â†’ [(a * b) / c] is safe to do on the
      LHS of the goal, this tactic should not turn a solvable goal into
      an unsolvable one.

      After running, the tactic does some basic rewriting to simplify
      fractions, e.g., that [a * b / b = a]. *)
