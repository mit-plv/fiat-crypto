Remaining work needed for Gallina verification code
---------------------------------------------------
+ GF subtraction
+ efficient GF exponentiation
+ efficient GF inverse
+ make EdDSA point addition use ModularBaseSystem
+ represent scalars (Fl) in ModularBaseSystem (large c)
+ elliptic curve decidable equality
+ negation of elliptic curve points
+ canonical representations of field elements
